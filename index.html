          I am doing mountain climbing every weekend.<br>
          Every weekend, actually every Sunday morning, I go out with my backpack and two bottles of water to climb the mountain Kwan-Ack.
          Kwan-Ack San(mountain) is located in southern suburbs of Seoul City and Northern part of Kwacheon City in Kyunggi province.

          The photo shows the 632 m high Gwanaksan with its radar observatory on the summit. Gwanaksan is located in the southern suburbs of Seoul in South Korea. This picture was taken from Cheonggyesan, which is a mountain range East of Gwanaksan.
